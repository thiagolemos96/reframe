## 📖 About the Project

This project is a **Web Application (PWA)** designed to run on mobile devices, with a special focus on giving a new purpose to older hardware (like the **iPad Mini 2**).

Unlike standard websites, this app is optimized to work **100% Offline**. It utilizes the browser's **IndexedDB** to store hundreds of photos locally, bypassing the standard LocalStorage limitations.

### 🎯 The Problem
Old tablets often become too slow for modern web browsing or lose support for mainstream photo apps. This project creates a lightweight and internet-independent slideshow.

* **⚙️ Customization:**
    * Transition time control.
    * Effects (Ken Burns Zoom, Fade).
    * Image fit (Cover screen or Contain image).
* **🕰️ Info Widget:** Displays clock, date, and weather (Weather requires internet).
* **⚡ Legacy Optimized:** Configured to run on older Safari versions (iOS 12+).

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Weather:** The weather feature consumes an external API. It will not work if the device is Offline.
* **Performance:** When adding many photos (e.g., +50) at once on very old devices (iPad Mini 2/3), the browser might reload due to limited RAM. It is recommended to add photos in batches of 10 or 20.
